> windows rewrite of that one shell yeah

Even more begineer than dw text editor. Your grandma could do it.
I was bored soooo yeah nothing much to say here. 
Basically just https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/ but in windows and i added a few more in built functions just because...

They are as follows:
- exit
- mkdir
- rmdir
- del
- cls
- copy
- echo
- type

Didn't bother to add any functionality to flags for these commands. get out now ok bye
